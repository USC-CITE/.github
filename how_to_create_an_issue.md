# How to create an issue?

[Github has their own documentation on how to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository). 

In this guide, we will go over the process of including templates for your issue description.

> We are not using GitHub's form schema syntax. All of our issue and pull request templates are written in Markdown.
