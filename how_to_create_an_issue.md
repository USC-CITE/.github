# How to create an issue?

[GitHub has their own documentation on how to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository). 

In this guide, we will go over the process of including templates for your issue description.

> [!NOTE]
> We are not using GitHub's form schema syntax. All of our issue and pull request templates are written in Markdown. 

1. If templates exist, open one of them when creating a new issue. ![When creating a new issue, issue templates will be displayed as links to their corresponding template.](assets/how_to_create_an_issue/open_issue_templates.png)

2. When the template has loaded, click the button with the text `Code` (encircled in red) to display the raw template. Alternatively, you can download the file instead (encircled with blue). ![The 'Code' button in desktop's is located on the left side of the screen, next to the 'Preview' button.](assets/how_to_create_an_issue/issue_template.png)

3. Copy the raw content of the template. ![The raw content of the template will display as normal text. Copy the text.](assets/how_to_create_an_issue/raw_issue_template.png)

4. Go back to the new issues page and click the `Open a blank issue` link.
